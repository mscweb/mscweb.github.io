Images for all Morrisville webpages need to be compressed. This can be accomplished by using the "Save for Web" feature in Photoshop. Images should be compressed for faster download times, especially since a large portion of our user base is browsing our site on a mobile device. Be aware that not everyone has unlimited data. [Compressing Images in Photoshop - Save for Web](http://tv.adobe.com/watch/understanding-adobe-photoshop-cs6/save-for-web/)

There are four types of images used in Morrisville websites: JPG, GIF, PNG, and SVG. For best compression, use:

* JPG - Optimized for photographs or images with gradients
* GIF - Use only for simple images with less than 256 colors, can have a transparent background

To compress complex images such as photos with a transparent background or vector images: 

* PNG - Optimized for photographs or detailed images with a transparent background ([Incompatible with IE6](http://caniuse.com/png-alpha))
* SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) - Vector graphics such as logos ([Incompatible with IE8](http://caniuse.com/svg))

For more information, see [Digital Image File Types](http://users.wfu.edu/matthews/misc/graphics/formats/formats.html) and [Using SVG](http://css-tricks.com/using-svg/)

High resolution devices and responsive sites may require images with a higher resolution. [Choosing a Responsive Image Solution](http://mobile.smashingmagazine.com/2013/07/08/choosing-a-responsive-image-solution/)

**Note:** Not all users have Photoshop. Use discretion when adding an image uploader to a utility.
