If you want to get Jekyll running on Windows I suggest these [steps](http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/) but use ruby 1.9.3 instead of ruby 2.0. With ruby 2.0, I ran into this [error](https://github.com/brianmario/yajl-ruby/issues/116). I don't have much use for ruby these days so I just went back to v1.9.3 rather than trying to find a solution for v2.0

Looks like I got a second use for ruby other than sass.
